### üöî Game Rules

During a duel, two players stand on opposite sides of the screen and, based on an image, must identify what it depicts according to the category of the duel. The prompter, using a separate device, evaluates the response as "OK." A player may choose the "PASS" option, which, upon the prompter's confirmation, deducts 3 seconds from the player's time and changes the image to be identified.
